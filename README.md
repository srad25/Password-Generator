# Password-Generator

In this project, I had to develop a Password Generator that prompted the user for
atleast one parameter ranging from selecting: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or 
special characters. the length of the password had to be between 8 and 128 characters. After the prompts 
were followed by the user a random password was generated.
